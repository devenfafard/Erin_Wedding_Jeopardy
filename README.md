# Metz-Duncan Jeopardy 
A custom Jeopardy game built for The Metz-Duncan Engagement Party on 10/24/2020.

## Overview  
Metz-Duncan Jeopardy is a simple Jeopardy style game with questions written by the bride. This was a quicky and dirty application that was pulled together over the course of a weekend. It mostly served as way to keep me sharp on my Unity skills and gave me an oppurtunity to dive a little deeper into UI, since it is admittedly one of my weak areas. This project was built with one thing in mind - simplicity.  

#### Data Box:   
**Platform:** PC, Mac  
**Engine:** Unity 2019.4.12f


## Game Description  
#### Gameplay  
We pared down the core mechanics of Jeopardy to the most engaging aspect - getting people to answer questions. At the party, the game was displayed on an outdoor projector screen. Party guests were randomly split into 3 teams, designated by small auction style signs. Participants "buzzed in" by holding up their signs and answering on behalf of their team.  

The controller scheme is as follows:  
**Select Question:** left click  
**Dismiss Question:** [Space] 
**Start Game:**  [Enter]  
**Exit Game:** [Exit]  
**Give Points to Team A:** [1]  
**Give Points to Team B:** [2]  
**Give Points to Team C:** [3]  



## Post Mortem  
#### What tasks were accomplished?  
The main mechanic of Jeopardy was implemented in addition to a "hacky" score tracker. A PC and Mac build were created, which was difficult for me considering that I had never built and tested for Macs before.

#### What planned tasks were not done?  
Player objects, daily doubles, question timers, and many other tasks were not completed. Since we were playing this outside, it didn't make sense to make it as complex as a real Jeopardy game. Eventually, I want to revisit this project and give it a proper tune-up.

#### What would I do differently?  
Given a do-over I would have paid more attention to UI polish. I cobbled together free assets and screenshots off of the couple's wedding website to get the final product, which did well enough for what we needed this to do, but admittedly doesn't look the best close up.
